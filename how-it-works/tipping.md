# Tipping Feature Documentation

## Introduction

Tipping is a new feature on GibWork that allows open-source maintainers to reward contributors' efforts. 
Tipping offers a concrete means of showing appreciation and recognition that goes beyond the conventional ways.


## Significance

The following explains the significance of the Tipping feature:

### Recognition
Acknowledging the efforts and dedication of contributors through tipping is a great way to recognize their valuable contributions and encourage them to continue positively engaging with the project.

### Community Building
Tipping fosters a sense of community among contributors. It creates a positive atmosphere where individuals feel appreciated and more connected to the project and its goals, leading to increased collaboration and support.

### Retention
Recognizing and rewarding contributors' efforts can contribute to the long-term stability of a project. Tipping helps retain talented contributors who might otherwise move on to other projects.

### Motivation
Tipping can be a great way to show appreciation for open-source contributors who work on projects without any monetary compensation. It can serve as a token of recognition and encouragement, motivating them to continue their work with passion and dedication.


## How to Tip

Tipping on GibWork is a straightforward process that can be done directly from the project dashboard. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Select the Contributor**: Identify the contributor you want to tip. This could be someone who has made a significant impact on your project through code contributions, community support, or documentation.

2. **Set the Amount**: Decide on the amount you want to tip. This can be a one-time gesture or a recurring tip, depending on the nature of the contribution and your budget.


## Syntax for Tipping

To tip a contributor, use the following syntax:

```markdown
@gibworkbot tip [amount] @username 
```

For example, to tip 100 USDC to a contributor with the username `@kkugwu`:

```markdown
@gibworkbot tip 100 @kkugwu
```

## How does it work ?

After using the syntax provided, @gibworkbot intructs you to follow these instructions:

1. Click on the **Gibtips** link to go to the page where you can add the tip amount to the escrow. The escrow is usually a non-custodial wallet such as Phantom, Solflare, etc.

2. Once the tip is added to the escrow, the contributor can click on the **Gibtips** link to claim the tip.


## Tipping Scenarios

- **Tip an Open Source Contributor**: Recognize the efforts of an open-source contributor who has made significant contributions to your project's development, documentation, or community support.

- **Tip Someone Reporting a Bug via GitHub Issues**: Acknowledge and reward users who take the time to report bugs or issues via GitHub. Their feedback helps improve the project's quality and reliability.

- **Tip Someone Opening a Pull Request**: Encourage and appreciate contributors who submit pull requests to enhance your project with new features, improvements, or bug fixes. Their contributions help evolve the project and keep it up-to-date.
